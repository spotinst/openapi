  summary: Initiate Roll
  description: >
    Roll an entire Ocean cluster or roll subsets of the cluster by specifying
    launchSpecIds or instanceNames. Performing this request will start the roll
    immediately, and the roll will take place according to defined batches. <br
    /> <br /> Note that the first response for a successful request will notify
    about the start of a roll. In order to check the status of a roll, you can
    use the GET Cluster Roll API using the roll identifier.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in
                    single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single
                    batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If
                    exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In
                    case of null as value, the default value in the backend will
                    be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in
                    percentage (%) of the batch.
