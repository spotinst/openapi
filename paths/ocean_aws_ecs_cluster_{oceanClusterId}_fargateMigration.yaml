  summary: Import Fargate To Existing Ocean Cluster
  description: >
    Import a Fargate service into an existing Ocean ECS cluster.

    Upon Fargate service import, Spot clones the selected Fargate services and
    runs them with the same VPC & Subnet settings on EC2 spot Instances.

    Ocean will automatically and seamlessly predict and replace spot instances
    before they are interrupted, ensuring the uptime of the cluster and
    providing cost-savings of up to 90% over Fargate-enabled ECS clusters.
