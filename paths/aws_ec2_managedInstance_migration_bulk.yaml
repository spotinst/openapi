  summary: Import Multiple Instances from AWS
  description: >
    <ul> <li>Import multiple stateful instances from AWS into Stateful Node,
    preserving both instance data and persistence settings.

    <li>This call initiates migration for all instances and returns the
    associated migration IDs.

    <li>To check the status of multiple migrations, use the `Get Multiple
    Instance Migration Status` call.

    <li>Note: The response contains a `failures` field. In the event that one or
    more instances failed to migrate, this field will provide the corresponding
    resource IDs and error messages. If all migrations were successful, this
    field will return an empty list. <ul>
