  summary: Create Instance Signal
  description: >-
    The instance signal API is used for notifying Spot about the instance state,
    so Spot can act accordingly. Supported signals are - INSTANCE_READY –
    Whenever this signal is sent, Spot will register the instance to the ELB
    INSTANCE_READY_TO_SHUTDOWN – Whenever this signal is sent, Spot will
    terminate the instance after it was marked for termination. Important - You
    need to define the expected signals for your Elastigroup in the group
    configuration.
