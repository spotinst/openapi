  summary: Import Fargate To New Ocean Cluster
  description: >
    This API copies the configuration from a Fargate service into the
    corresponding fields of an Ocean object.

    (This process is commonly referred to as importing.)

    The API returns an Ocean object that is suitable for use in the [Create
    API](https://docs.spot.io/api/#operation/oceanEcsCreate/) to create a new
    Ocean cluster based on your Fargate configuration.

    If you are migrating a Fargate service that has tags, you must run the Opt
    In procedure on your Amazon account or IAM role.

    This is required in order to obtain the necessary Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
    and resource identifier format for your ECS tasks, container instances, and
    services.

    For more information about the required ARN and the Opt In procedure, see
    the following pages:


    * [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and
    identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#ecs-resource-ids)

    * [Migrating your Amazon ECS deployment to the new ARN and resource
    identifier
    format](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/migrating-your-amazon-ecs-deployment-to-the-new-arn-and-resource-id-format-2/)


    The API requires one of the following permissions to be defined in Spot -


    * Permission: Account Editor (See [User
    Roles](https://docs.spot.io/administration/users/)) or

    * Action: ocean:importOceanFromFargate (See [Access
    Policies](https://docs.spot.io/administration/access-policies/))
