  summary: Simulate an Instance Interruption
  description: >-
    The simulate instance interruption API is used for simulating a spot
    interruption in AWS, so that customers can verify specific applicative
    behaviors in case an interruption takes place. Once the interruption api is
    called, instances posted in the API body will be terminated in AWS, thus
    mocking a spot interruption.
