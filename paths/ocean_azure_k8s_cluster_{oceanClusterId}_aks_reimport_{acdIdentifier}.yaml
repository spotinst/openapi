  summary: ReImport Cluster
  description: >
    In the special case that Ocean has already imported an AKS cluster and we
    need to reimport it again (because the customer has updated the AKS cluster
    through Azure directly). The reimport process will reimport and immediately
    update the Ocean cluster configuration from the given AKS cluster.

    The ReImport Cluster API call returns a JSON formatted Ocean cluster
    specification after the update of the given AKS cluster.


    Prerequisites:

    * To initiate the reimport from AKS, run the following script on a machine
    with the kubectl command-line tool installed and configured (Ensure the
    correct context is set in kube config.)

    ```

    curl -fsSL
    https://spotinst-public.s3.amazonaws.com/integrations/kubernetes/aks/spot-aks-connector/init.sh
    | \

    bash -s acd-12345678

    ```

    * The import identifier has the prefix “acd-“ followed by eight characters.
    Use the same identifier as input for this API call.

    * Please make sure the results K8S job is running on an updated node (i.e.
    node that was updated by Azure directly)

    * Learn more about the [Import from
    AKS](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/getting-started/aks?id=import-process-overview)
    process.
