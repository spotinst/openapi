  summary: Create VM Signal
  description: >-
    The VM signal API is used for notifying Spot about the VM state so that Spot
    can act accordingly. Supported signals are vmReady – Whenever this signal is
    sent, Spot will register the instance to the relevant Load Balancer and
    Application Gateway. vmReadyToShutdown – When this signal is received after
    a vm is detached; we will immediately terminate the vm. You must define the
    expected signals for your Elastigroup in the group configuration.
