    which can be grouped and/or filtered by label/annotaion.\

    For example - application name (webapp, backend), environment (production,
    staging), version etc.\

    The response will contain a breakdown of the cluster resource costs($) in
    terms of compute (CPU, memory) and storage.

    The response will group the cluster usage costs based on preselected default
    of application namespace or user selected label or annotation.\
