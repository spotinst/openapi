    description: |
      Managed Instances are Spots solution for launching and managing a single compute instance.
      On the AWS cloud, for a standard single instance workload, an On-Demand EC2 instance is launched.
      The instance is expected to be highly available, easily manageable, and integrate well with additional services and monitoring tools.
      For more information please review the concepts section.

      * Please log in to the [Spot Console](https://console.spotinst.com) to create an API token. Navigate to `Settings` and select `API`.
      * The [Spot Console](https://console.spotinst.com) provides both permanent and temporary tokens. Select your preferred token type and click `Generate Token`.
      * Give your token a name and click `Generate`.
      > NOTE: Remember to keep your tokens secret; treat them just like passwords! They act on your behalf when interacting with the API. Do not share your personal access tokens with anyone outside your organization. Dont hard-code them into your programs; instead, opt to use them as environment variables. Please contact our support if youre concerned your token has been compromised.
