    description: You must specify either `SpotDeployment` OR `SpotDeployments` but not both. Every SpotDeployment has to be unique. If more than one `SpotDeployment` has been configured, no `traffic` managers can be set as part of the RolloutSpec. For such case ensure that each of the chosen SpotDeployments are being exposed with different Kubernetes services
