title: Ocean CD Verification Metric
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    example: 5xx-errors
    description: The name of the verification metric
  dryRun:
    type: boolean
    example: false
    description: Defines whether the metric should have an impact on the result of the rollout
  interval:
    type: string
    example: 5m
    description: Defines an interval string (30s, 5m, 1h) between each verification measurements. If omitted, will perform a single measurement. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
  initialDelay:
    type: string
    description: How long to wait before starting this metric measurements. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
    example: 1m
  count:
    type: integer
    description: The number of times to run the measurement. If both interval and count are omitted, the effective count is 1. If only interval is specified, metric runs indefinitely. If count > 1, interval must be specified. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
    example: 10
  successCondition:
    type: string
    description: An expression which determines if a measurement is considered successful. The keyword `result` is a variable reference to the value of measurement. Results can be both structured data or primitive. If successCondition is set, then failureCondition is not allowed. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
    example: "result[0] <= 0.95"
  failureCondition:
    type: string
    description: An expression which determines if a measurement is considered failed. If failureCondition is set, then successCondition is not allowed. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
    example: "result[0] >= 1.2"
  failureLimit:
    type: integer
    example: 2
    description: The maximum number of times the measurement is allowed to fail, before the entire metric is considered failed. Default is 0. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
  consecutiveErrorLimit:
    type: integer
    example: 4
    description: The maximum number of times the measurement is allowed to error in succession, before the metric is considered error. Default is 4. When choosing `Jenkins` as the provider, there is no need to send this variable.
