title: Ocean CD Verification Metric
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  dryRun:
    type: boolean
    example: false
    description: should the metric have an impact on the result of the rollout
  interval:
    type: string
    example: 5m
    description: defines an interval string (30s, 5m, 1h) between each verification measurements. If omitted, will perform a single measurement
  initialDelay:
    type: string
    description: how long the should wait before starting this metric measurements
    example: 1m
  count:
    type: integer
    description: the number of times to run the measurement. If both interval and count are omitted, the effective count is 1. If only interval is specified, metric runs indefinitely. If count > 1, interval must be specified.
    example: 10
  successCondition:
    type: string
    description: expression which determines if a measurement is considered successful. The keyword `result` is a variable reference to the value of measurement. Results can be both structured data or primitive. if successCondition is set, then failureCondition is not allowed.
    example: "result[0] <= 0.95"
  failureCondition:
    type: string
    description: an expression which determines if a measurement is considered failed. if failureCondition is set, then successCondition is not allowed.
    example: "result[0] >= 1.2"
  failureLimit:
    type: integer
    description: the maximum number of times the measurement is allowed to fail, before the entire metric is considered Failed default is 0
  consecutiveErrorLimit:
    type: integer
    description: the maximum number of times the measurement is allowed to error in succession, before the metric is considered error default is 4
