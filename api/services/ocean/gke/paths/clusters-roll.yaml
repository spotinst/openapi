  summary: "Initiate Roll"
  description: >
    Roll an entire Ocean cluster or roll subsets of the cluster by specifying launchSpecIds or instanceNames.
    Performing this request will start the roll immediately, and the roll will take place according to defined batches.
    <br />
    <br />
    Note that the first response for a successful request will notify about the start of a roll.
    In order to check the status of a roll, you can use the GET Cluster Roll API using the roll identifier.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In case of null as value, the default value in the backend will be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in percentage (%) of the batch.
