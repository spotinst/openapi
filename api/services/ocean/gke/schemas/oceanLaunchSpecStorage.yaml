    description: |
      Defines the number of local SSDs to be attached per node for this VNG.

      If instanceTypes are configured in this VNG, **all of them** must support the value of localSsdCount.
      Otherwise, if the Ocean cluster has instanceTypes on a permit list, **at least one** must support the value of localSsdCount.

      For more information about local SSDs, it is recommended to review the GCP documentation:
      * [GCP Local SSD](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#localssds)
      * [Local SSDs and machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#local_ssd_machine_type_restrictions)
      * [GKE Using local SSDs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/local-ssd#use)
