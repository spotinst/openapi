properties:
  isEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: Enable the Ocean Kubernetes Autoscaler.
    default: true
    example: true
  cooldown:
    type: integer
    description: Cooldown period between scaling actions.
    default: null
    example: 30
  resourceLimits:
    type: object
    description: Optionally set upper and lower bounds on the resource usage of the cluster.
    properties:
      maxMemoryGib:
        type: integer
        description: The maximum memory in GiB units that can be allocated to the cluster.
        example: 1500
      maxVcpu:
        type: integer
        description: The maximum CPU in vCPU units that can be allocated to the cluster.
        example: 750

    type: object
    description: Autoscaling scale down operations.
    properties:
      maxScaleDownPercentage:
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 100
        description: The maximum percentage allowed to scale down in a single scaling action.

  headRoom:
    type: object
    description: >
      Spare resource capacity management enabling fast assignment of pods without waiting for new resources to launch.
    properties:
      cpuPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >
          Optionally configure the number of CPUs to allocate the headroom.
          CPUs are denoted in millicores where 1000 millicores = 1 vCPU.
        example: 0
      memoryPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: Optionally configure the amount of memory (MiB) to allocate the headroom.
        example: 0
      gpuPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: How much GPU to allocate to a headroom unit.
        example: 0
      numOfUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The number of units to retain as headroom, where each unit has the defined headroom CPU and memory.
        example: 0
  isAutoConfig:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Use automatic headroom. When set to true, the values under cluster.autoScaler.headroom are not effective, as Ocean configures and optimizes headroom automatically.
    default: true
    example: false
  autoHeadroomPercentage:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Optionally set the auto headroom percentage. Set a number between 0-200 to control the headroom percent of the cluster.
      Relevant when isAutoConfig=true.
    example: null
  enableAutomaticAndManualHeadroom:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      When set to true, both automatic and per-VNG manual headroom to be saved concurrently and independently in the cluster.
      prerequisite: isAutoConfig must be true
    example: true
