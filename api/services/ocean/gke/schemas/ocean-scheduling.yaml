      Define time(s) for a scheduled shutdown.

        description: >
          Flag to enable or disable the shutdown hours mechanism.
          When false, the mechanism is deactivated and the cluster remains in its current state.
        example: true
      timeWindows:
        type: array
        description: >
          Set time windows for shutdown hours. Specify a list of timeWindows that includes at least one time window. Each string is in the format of - ddd:hh:mm-ddd:hh:mm ddd = day of week = Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat hh = hour 24 = 0 -23 mm = minute = 0 - 59.
          Time windows should not overlap. Required when cluster.scheduling.isEnabled = True.

            Describes whether the task is enabled. When true, the task runs. When false, it does not run.
            Required for the cluster.scheduling.tasks object.
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          example: 0 1 * * *
          description: >
            A valid cron expression.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In case of null as value, the default value in the backend will be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in percentage (%) of the batch.
