  - isEnabled
properties:
  isEnabled:
    type: boolean
    example: true
    description: >
      Used to enable or disable the optimization windows mechanism. Must be a boolean (null is invalid). When true, at least one window must be defined. When false, windows can be empty or omitted.

      required:
        - cronExpression
        - duration
        - effects
      properties:
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          example: "0 0 * * *"
          description: >
            A valid cron expression defining when the optimization window starts.
            For example: "0 0 * * *" (daily at midnight).
            The cron job runs in UTC time and follows Unix cron format.
        duration:
          type: string
          example: "8h"
          description: >
            The duration of the optimization window. Must be in the format <number><unit> where unit is 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours), or 'd' (days). Examples: 10m, 5h, 2d.
        effects:
          type: array
          minItems: 1
          description: >
            The list of effects that will be applied during this optimization window.

            type: string
            enum: ["ignorePdb", "ignoreRestrictScaleDown"]
          example: ["ignorePdb", "ignoreRestrictScaleDown"]
