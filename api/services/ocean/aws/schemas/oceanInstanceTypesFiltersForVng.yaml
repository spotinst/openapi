  List of instance types filters. The instance types that match with all filters compose the Virtual Node Group's instanceTypes parameter.\
  The architectures that come from the Virtual Node Group's images will be taken into account when using this parameter.\
  Cannot be configured together with Virtual Node Group's instanceTypes and with the Cluster's whitelist/blacklist/filters.
