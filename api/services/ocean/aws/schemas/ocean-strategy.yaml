title: Ocean Cluster Strategy
description: |
  An object defining the cluster strategy with regard to waiting periods and utilization of on-demand and reserved instances.
properties:
  utilizeReservedInstances:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    example: true
    description: |
      If reserved instances exist, Ocean will utilize them before launching spot instances.
  fallbackToOd:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    example: true
    description: |
      If no spot instance markets are available, enable Ocean to launch on-demand instances instead.
  spotPercentage:
    type: integer
    default: 100
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
    description: |
      The desired percentage of Spot instances out of all running instances.\
      Only available when the field is **not** set in any VNG directly (launchSpec.strategy.spotPercentage).
    example: 100
  gracePeriod:
    type: integer
    default: 600
    example: 600
    description: |
      The amount of time, in seconds, from the time the instance has launched to the time its first health check starts.
  drainingTimeout:
    type: integer
    example: 60
    description: |
      The configurable amount of time that Ocean will wait for the draining process to complete before terminating an instance. If you have not defined a draining timeout, the default of 300 seconds will be used.
  utilizeCommitments:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If savings plans commitment has available capacity, Ocean will utilize them alongside RIs (if exist) to maximize cost efficiency.
    example: false
    default: false
  clusterOrientation:
    type: object
    properties:
      availabilityVsCost:
        type: string
        description: |
          You can control the approach that Ocean takes while launching nodes by configuring this value.
        enum: [ costOriented, balanced, cheapest ]
        example: balanced
        default: balanced
  spreadNodesBy:
    type: string
    description:  |
      You can control the approach that Ocean takes while spreading the nodes across types and AZ by configuring this value.
    enum: [cost, vcpu, count]
    example: vcpu
