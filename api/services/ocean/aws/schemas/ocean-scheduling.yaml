          description: >
            Describes whether the task is enabled. When True, the task runs. When False, it does not run. Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          example: 0 1 * * *
          description: >
            A valid cron expression.
            For example : " * * * * * ".
            The cron job runs in UTC time and is in Unix cron format. (See the Cron Expression Validator Script.)
            Required field for taskType "clusterRoll", optional field for taskType "amiAutoUpdate".
        taskType:
          type: string
          example: clusterRoll
          enum: ["clusterRoll", "amiAutoUpdate"]
          description: >
            The activity that you are scheduling. Valid values: "clusterRoll", "amiAutoUpdate". Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.
        parameters:
          type: object
          description: | 
            This field will be compatible to the task type field. 
            If taskType is defined as "clusterRoll", use cluster roll object in parameters.
