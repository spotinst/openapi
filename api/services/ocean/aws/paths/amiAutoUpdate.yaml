  description: |
    Update the Ocean EKS cluster's VNGs with the latest image or the image matching the control plane's version after upgrading, by specifying ‘patch' or 'minorVersion’.
    Performing this request will update the VNGs with new AMI if available, and run a cluster roll if set.
    If the response is successful, the old and new AMIs will be included in the response along with the updated VNGs.
    If a cluster roll is set in the request, the first response for a successful request will indicate the start of a roll.
    In order to check the status of the roll, you can use the GET Roll API.
