  resourceLimits:
    type: object
    description: >
      Optionally set upper and lower bounds on the resource usage of the cluster.
    properties:
      maxMemoryGib:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The maximum memory in GiB units that can be allocated to the cluster. minimum value: 1.
        example: 1
      maxVcpu:
        type: integer
        description: >

    properties:
        evaluationPeriods:
          type: integer
          example: 4
        maxScaleDownPercentage:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Would represent the maximum % to scale-down. Number between 1-100

  headroom:
    type: object
    description: >
      Spare resource capacity management enabling fast assignment of Pods without waiting for new resources to launch.
    properties:
      cpuPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >
          Optionally configure the number of CPUs to allocate per headroom unit. CPUs are denoted in CPU units, where 1024 units = 1 vCPU.
        example: 2048
      memoryPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >

  isAutoConfig:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Use automatic headroom. When set to true, the values under cluster.autoScaler.headroom are not effective, as Ocean configures and optimizes headroom automatically.
    example: false
  autoHeadroomPercentage:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Optionally set the auto-headroom percentage. Set a number between 0-200 to control the headroom % of the cluster. Relevant when isAutoConfig=true.
