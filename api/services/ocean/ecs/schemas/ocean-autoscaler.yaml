title: Ocean Autoscaler
description: >
  The Ocean ECS Autoscaler.
properties:
  isEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Enable the Ocean ECS Autoscaler.
    example: true
  cooldown:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Cooldown period between scaling actions. Value should be cooldown period in seconds, greater than 180.
    example: 300
  resourceLimits:
    type: object
    description: >
      Optionally set upper and lower bounds on the resource usage of the cluster.
    properties:
      maxMemoryGib:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The maximum memory in GiB units that can be allocated to the cluster. Minimum value: 1.
        example: 1
      maxVcpu:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The maximum CPU in vCPU units that can be allocated to the cluster. Minimum value: 1.
        example: 1
  down:
    type: object
    description: >
      Autoscaling scale down operations.
    properties:
        evaluationPeriods:
          type: integer
          example: 4
        maxScaleDownPercentage:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The maximum portion (as a %) of nodes that will be scaled down at once out of the total number of potential nodes to scale down.
            Example: If there are 10 nodes to scale down and the parameter is 50%, then only 5 nodes will be scaled down at once.
            The other 5 nodes will be scaled down in the next autoscaling iteration.
          example: 20
  headroom:
    type: object
    description: >
      Spare resource capacity management enabling fast assignment of pods without waiting for new resources to launch.
    properties:
      cpuPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >
          Optionally configure the number of CPUs to allocate per headroom unit. CPUs are denoted in CPU units, where 1024 units = 1 vCPU.
        example: 2048
      memoryPerUnit:
        type: integer
        description: >
          Optionally configure the amount of memory (MiB) to allocate per headroom unit.
        example: 3
      numOfUnits:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The number of units to retain as headroom, where each unit has the defined headroom CPU and memory.
        example: 2
  isAutoConfig:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Use automatic headroom. When set to true, the values under cluster.autoScaler.headroom are not effective, as Ocean configures and optimizes headroom automatically.
    example: false
  autoHeadroomPercentage:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Optionally set the auto-headroom percentage. Set a number between 0-200 to control the headroom % of the cluster. Relevant when isAutoConfig=true.
    example: 20
  shouldScaleDownNonServiceTasks:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Option to scale down non-service tasks. If not set, Ocean does not scale down standalone tasks.
    default: false
    example: true
  enableAutomaticAndManualHeadroom:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      When set to true, both automatic and per custom launch specification manual headroom to be saved concurrently and independently in the cluster.
      prerequisite: isAutoConfig must be true
    example: false
