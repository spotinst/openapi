            Describes whether the task is enabled. When true, the task will run. When false, it does not run. Required for the object cluster.scheduling.tasks.

The cron runs in the UTC time zone and is in Unix cron format [Cron Expression Validator Script](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/5/crontab/). Only one of ‘frequency' or ‘cronExpression' should be used at a time. Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In case of null as value, the default value in the backend will be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in percentage (%) of the batch.
