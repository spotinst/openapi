blockDeviceMappings:
  type: array
  description: >
    Block devices that are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes.
    This parameter and rootVolumeSize cannot be in the spec at the same time.
    This parameter can be null, but if not null, it must contain at least one block device.
  items:
   type: object
   properties:
    deviceName:
      type: string

      example: "/dev/xvda"
    ebs:
      type: object
      description: >
        Set EBS properties.
      properties:
        deleteOnTermination:
          type: boolean
          description: >
            Flag to delete the EBS on instance termination.
          example: false
        encrypted:

          example: false
        iops:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Must be greater than or equal to 0.
          example: 1
        kmsKeyId:
          type: string
          example: "alias/aws/ebs"
        snapshotId:
          type: string
          example: "snap-abcdefghi111110"
        volumeType:
          type: string
          description: >
            Set volume type.
          example: "gp2"
        volumeSize:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Set volume size (in GB). When using this property, you cannot use dynamicVolumeSize. You must use one of the other. Volume size should be greater or equal than the size configured in the AMI.
        dynamicVolumeSize:
          type: object
          description: >
            Set dynamic volume size properties. When using this object, you cannot use volumeSize. You must use one or the other.
          properties:
            baseSize:

              required: true
              description: >
                Initial size per volume.
              example: 50
            resource:
              type: string
              required: true
              example: "CPU"
            sizePerResourceUnit:
              type: integer
              description: >
                Additional size per resource unit (in GB). For example: if baseSize=50, and sizePerResourceUnit=20, and an instance with 2 CPU is launched - its disk size will be: 90GB
              example: 20
