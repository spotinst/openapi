  summary: "Initiate Roll"
  description: >
    Roll an entire Ocean cluster or roll subsets of the cluster by specifying launchSpecIds or instanceIds. Performing this request will start the roll immediately according to defined batches.
    Note that the first response for a successful request will indicate the start of a roll. In order to check the status of a roll, you can use the [GET Roll API](https://docs.spot.io/api//#operation/oceanEcsRollGetSingleRoll) using the roll identifier.
