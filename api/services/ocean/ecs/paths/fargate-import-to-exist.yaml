  summary: "Import Fargate To Existing Ocean Cluster"
  description: |
    Import a Fargate service into an existing Ocean ECS cluster.
    Upon Fargate service import, Spot clones the selected Fargate services and runs them with the same VPC & Subnet settings on EC2 Spot Instances.
    Ocean will automatically and seamlessly predict and replaces Spot Instances before they are interrupted, ensuring the uptime of the cluster and providing cost-savings of up to 90% over Fargate-enabled ECS clusters.
