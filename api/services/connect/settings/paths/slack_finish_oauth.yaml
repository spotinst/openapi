  description: 'After the user installs/authorizes the Spot Connect Slack app in their
    workspace,

    they will be redirected back to the Slack integration page in the Fylamynt web
    app

    with an authorization code. The web app will then call this API endpoint with
    that

    ''code'' in the query parameter. Instead, if the user rejects to authorize the
    Fylamynt

    Slack app in their workspace, the API request from the web app will contain the

    ''error'' code (e.g., error=access_denied) returned from Slack. The following
    code

    processes the request and returns success or failure response to the web app.

    Slack instance alias is part of ''state'' query parameter, previously ''state''
    query

    parameter contained subdomain.'
