  description: "Create a new secret for a given service.\n\nThe `Example model` contains
    models for all services that can be created.\nWhen calling this endpoint for a
    specific service, only the credentials\nfor that service should be provided in
    the payload.\n\nThe payload should be structured with the credentials inside a
    'credentials' key.\nFor example, for an S3 integration:\n\n{\n    \"credentials\":
    {\n        \"alias\": \"my-s3-integration\",\n        \"target\": \"my-target\",\n
    \       \"name\": \"my-bucket-name\"\n    }\n}\n\nNot all fields from all_input_models
    need to be sent in the payload,\nonly those relevant to the specific service being
    created.\n\nResponse will be the instance credentials that was created."
