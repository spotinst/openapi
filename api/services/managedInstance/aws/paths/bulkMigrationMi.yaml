  description: >
    <ul>
    <li>Import multiple stateful instances from AWS into Managed Instance, preserving both instance data and persistence settings.
    
    <li>This call initiates migration for all instances and returns the associated migration IDs.
    
    <li>To check the status of multiple migrations, use the `Get Multiple Instance Migration Status` call.
    
    <li>Note: The response contains a `failures` field. In the event that one or more instances failed to migrate, this field will provide the corresponding resource IDs and error messages. If all migrations were successful, this field will return an empty list.
