  summary: "Create VM Signal"
  description:
    The VM signal API is used for notifying Spot about the VM state so that Spot can act accordingly.
    Supported signals are vmReady – Whenever this signal is sent, Spot will register the instance to the relevant Load Balancer and Application Gateway.
    vmReadyToShutdown – When this signal is received after a vm is detached; we will immediately terminate the vm.
    You must define the expected signals for your Elastigroup in the group configuration.
