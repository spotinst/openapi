    description: |
      * Define the time windows in which the underlying VM will be set as an on-demand lifecycle type.
      * During the entire time window, the rest of the strategy process will be paused.
      * Switching between on-demand and Spot VM types at the enter/exit of the time window will trigger the recycling of the stateful node.
