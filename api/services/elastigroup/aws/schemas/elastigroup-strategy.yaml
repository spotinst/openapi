    maximum: 100
    example: 100
    default: 0
    description: >
      The percentage of Elastigroup that will run with spot market capacity
  onDemandCount:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    example: 0
    description: >
      Minimum number of instances that will always be on-demand
  availabilityVsCost:
      type: string
      enum: [costOriented, availabilityOriented, balanced, cheapest, equalAzDistribution]

        How Elastigroup determines which instances to add and replace.
        (please read this article before using [Equal AZ Instance Distribution](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup-for-aws/concepts/general-concepts/equal-az-distribution))
  fallbackToOd:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    example: true
    description: |
      When set to `true` Elastigroup will launch On Demand instances if no spot market is available
  considerODPricing:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    example: false
    description: |
      When the value is set to `true`, Elastigroup will prioritize launching On-Demand instances if they are found to be more cost-effective than available Spot markets.
  utilizeReservedInstances:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      In case of any available Reserved Instances, Elastigroup will utilize them before purchasing Spot instances
    example: false
  utilizeCommitments:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If there are available Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, Elastigroup will utilize them before using Spot instances
      example: false
  restrictSingleAz:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Elastigroup will automatically scale your instances in the most available and cost efficient availability zone. Every evaluation will be done when there are no active instances in the group.
  drainingTimeout:
    type: integer
    example: 120
    description: >
      The time in seconds to allow the instance be drained from incoming TCP connections and detached from ELB before terminating it, during a scale down operation
  maxReplacementsPercentage:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
    example: 15
    description: >
      The percentage of active instances that can be replaced in parallel
  signals:
    type: array
    description: |
      The signals defined for this group. For more information refer the below article: [Signals](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup-for-aws/concepts/compute-concepts/using-signals-in-elastigroups)
    items:
      type: object
      properties:

        timeout:
          type: integer
          minimum: 60
          maximum: 1800
          description: |
            The timeout in seconds to hold the instance until a signal is sent.
            If no signal is sent the instance will be replaced (INSTANCE_READY) or we will terminate the instance (INSTANCE_READY_TO_SHUTDOWN) after the timeout.
          default: 1800
          example: 120
