    default: 0
    description: >
      The percentage of Elastigroup that will run with spot market capacity
  onDemandCount:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    example: 0
    description: >
      Minimum number of instances that will always be on-demand
  availabilityVsCost:
      type: string

        How Elastigroup determines which instances to add and replace.
        (please read this article before using [Equal AZ Instance Distribution](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup-for-aws/concepts/general-concepts/equal-az-distribution))
  fallbackToOd:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    example: true
    description: |
      When set to `true` Elastigroup will launch On Demand instances if no spot market is available
  utilizeReservedInstances:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      In case of any available Reserved Instances, Elastigroup will utilize them before purchasing Spot instances
    example: false
  drainingTimeout:
    type: integer
    example: 120
    description: >
      The time in seconds to allow the instance be drained from incoming TCP connections and detached from ELB before terminating it, during a scale down operation
  signals:
    type: array
    description: |
      The signals defined for this group. For more information refer the below article: [Signals](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup-for-aws/concepts/compute-concepts/using-signals-in-elastigroups)
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string

          enum: [INSTANCE_READY, INSTANCE_READY_TO_SHUTDOWN]
        timeout:
          type: integer
          minimum: 60
          maximum: 1800
          description: |
            The timeout in seconds to hold the instance until a signal is sent.
            If no signal is sent the instance will be replaced (INSTANCE_READY) or we will terminate the instance (INSTANCE_READY_TO_SHUTDOWN) after the timeout.
          default: 1800
          example: 120

    properties:
      performAt:
        type: string
        description: |
          Settings for maintenance strategy - possible values: timeWindow, never, always.
          performAt of type: 'never' OR 'timeWindow' can only be applied to groups with "availabilityOriented" OR groups with "persistence",
          other groups allow either 'always' type or nothing which also means always.
