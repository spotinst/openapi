title: AWS Volume Attachments
description: |
  Any volumes specified in this field will be automatically attached to every instance launched in the group.
  All volumes must be located within the availability zone of the group. 
  Additionally, the group must have at least one persistence configuration.
  If your group has more than one instance or you want to share the same volume between several instances,
  it's important to use [Amazon EBS Multi-Attach supported volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html).
  to enable concurrent attachment of the volumes to multiple instances. This ensures that your volumes can be effectively
  shared among instances in your group.
