title: Volume Specification Object
description: >
  EBS volume specifications such as volume type, IOPS, and size (GiB)
  that will be requested for the EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance in the cluster - required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined.
properties:
  volumeType:
    type: string
    description: >
      The volume type. Volume types supported are `gp2`, `io1`, and `standard` - required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined
    enum: ["gp2", "io1", "standard"]
    example: "io1"
  dynamicVolumeSize:
    $ref: "./dynamicVolumeSize.yaml"
  sizeInGB:
    type: integer
    description: >
      The volume size, in gigabytes (GiB).
      This can be a number from 1 - 1024.
      **If the volume type is EBS-optimized,
      the minimum value is 10** - required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined
    example: 8
  iops:
    type: integer
    description: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports.
    example: 200
