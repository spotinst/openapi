  summary: "AWS Elastigroup - Simulate An Instance Interruption"
  description:
    The simulate instance interruption API is used for simulating a spot interruption in AWS, so that customers can verify specific applicative behaviors in case an interruption takes place. Once the interruption api is called, instances posted in the API body will be terminated in AWS, thus mocking a spot interruption.
