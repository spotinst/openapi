  summary: "AWS Elastigroup - Create Instance Signal"
  description:
    The instance signal API is used for notifying Spot about the instance state, so Spot can act accordingly. Supported signals are - INSTANCE_READY – Whenever this signal is sent, Spot will register the instance to the ELB INSTANCE_READY_TO_SHUTDOWN – Whenever this signal is sent, Spot will terminate the instance after it was marked for termination. Important - You need to define the expected signals for your Elastigroup in the group configuration.
