  description:

    Instance Standby enables you to put an instance in Standby state , update or troubleshoot the instance, and then return the instance to service. Instances that are on standby are still part of the Elastigroup, but they don’t get application traffic.

    Whenever instance is standby state -

    It will be de-registered from all the ELBs / ALBs in the Elastigroup
    It won’t be affected from Scale down activities in the Elastigroup
    The instance health won’t be checked, and it won’t be replaced
    When the instance exits the Standby state -

    The instance will be register back to all the ELBs / ALBs that are defined in the Elastigroup
    It will be considered and affected from all the Elastigroup activities (helth checks, scaling, etc.)
