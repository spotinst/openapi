        ### Organizations and Accounts

        Each Spot account is assigned to an organization and a set of environment Accounts.
        An account is then linked to a specific cloud provider account.

        Spot accounts are given an ID in the format `act-123abcd` that is sent as a query parameter while performing API calls.

        To locate the account ID navigate to Settings -> Account in the Spot console.

        ### Organizations with a Single Account
        Each API call you make can be used with or without the account ID.

        ### Organizations with Multiple Accounts
        Each API call you make should be appended to the account ID. For example:

        GET `https://api.spotinst.io/aws/ec2/group?accountId=act-123de678`
        This call will return the list of Elastigroups for the specific Account used.

        > NOTE: If no `accountId` is provided, the default (dldest) account for the Organization will be used.
