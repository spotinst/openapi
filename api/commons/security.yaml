        ### Organization And Accounts

        Each Spot account is assigned to an organization and a set of environment Accounts.
        An account is then linked to a specific cloud provider account.
        
        Spot accounts are given an ID in the format `act-123abcd` that is sent as a query parameter while performing API calls.
    
        To locate the account ID navigate to Settings -> Account in the Spot console.
    
        ### Organizations With A Single Account
        Each API call you make can be used with or without the account ID.

        Organizations With Multiple Accounts
        Each API call you make should be appended to the account ID. For example:

        GET `https://api.spotinst.io/aws/ec2/group?accountId=act-123de678`
        This call will return the list of Elastigroups for the specific Account used.

        **Please note** â€“ If no accountId is provided, the default (Oldest) account for the Organization will be used
