      You must specify either `SpotDeployment` OR `SpotDeployments` but not
      both. Every SpotDeployment has to be unique. If more than one
      `SpotDeployment` has been configured, no `traffic` managers can be set as
      part of the RolloutSpec. For such case ensure that each of the chosen
      SpotDeployments are being exposed with different Kubernetes services
    items:
