                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in

                    batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If
                    exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In
                    case of null as value, the default value in the backend will
                    be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in
                    percentage (%) of the batch.
