title: Ocean Cluster Strategy
description: >
  An object defining the cluster strategy with regard to waiting periods and
  utilization of on-demand and reserved instances.
properties:
  utilizeReservedInstances:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    example: true
    description: >
      If reserved instances exist, Ocean will utilize them before launching spot
      instances.
  fallbackToOd:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    example: true
    description: >
      If no spot instance markets are available, enable Ocean to launch
      on-demand instances instead.
  spotPercentage:
    type: integer
    default: 100
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
    description: >
      The desired percentage of Spot instances out of all running instances.\

      Only available when the field is **not** set in any VNG directly
      (launchSpec.strategy.spotPercentage).
    example: 100
  gracePeriod:
    type: integer
    default: 300
    example: 300
    description: >
      The amount of time, in seconds, from the time the instance has launched to
      the time its first health check starts.
  drainingTimeout:
    type: integer
    example: 60
    description: >
      The configurable amount of time that Ocean will wait for the draining
      process to complete before terminating an instance. If you have not
      defined a draining timeout, the default of 300 seconds will be used.
  utilizeCommitments:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      If savings plans commitment has available capacity, Ocean will utilize
      them alongside RIs (if exist) to maximize cost efficiency.
    example: false
    default: false

    properties:
      availabilityVsCost:
        type: string
        description: >
          You can control the approach that Ocean takes while launching nodes by
          configuring this value.
        enum:
          - costOriented
          - balanced
          - cheapest
        example: balanced
        default: balanced
  spreadNodesBy:
    type: string
    description: |
      Ocean will spread the nodes across markets by this value.
    enum:
      - vcpu
      - count
    example: count
    default: count
