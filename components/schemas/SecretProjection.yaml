      If unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced
      Secret will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key
      and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected
      into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key
      is specified which is not present in the Secret, the volume setup will
      error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not
      contain the '..' path or start with '..'.
