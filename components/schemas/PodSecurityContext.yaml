  fsGroup:
    description: >-
      A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some
      volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to
      be owned by the pod:


      1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files
      created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are
      OR'd with rw-rw----


      If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any
      volume.

    type: integer
  runAsGroup:
    description: >-
      The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime
      default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both
      SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
      SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.
    title: Runasgroup
    type: integer
  runAsNonRoot:
    description: >-
      Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the
      Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run
      as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or
      false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in
      SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext,
      the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
    title: Runasnonroot
    type: boolean
  runAsUser:
    description: >-
      The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
      specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in
      SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext,
      the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that
      container.

  seLinuxOptions:

      - $ref: ./SELinuxOptions.yaml
    description: >-
      The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified, the
      container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each
      container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both
      SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
      SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.
    title: Selinuxoptions
  supplementalGroups:
    description: >-
      A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in
      addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will
      be added to any container.
