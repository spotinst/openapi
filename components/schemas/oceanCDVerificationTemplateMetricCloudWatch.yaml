                  description: >-
                    A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the
                    identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the
                    unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
                    name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a
                    new variation of that metric. You can assign up to 30
                    dimensions to a metric

                          only ASCII characters, must include at least one

              description: >-
                The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For
                metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one
                minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For
                high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less
                than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any
                multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored
                by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1
                second

        label:
          type: string
          example: Cluster CpuUtilization
          description: >-
            A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is
            especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what
            the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a
            CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is
            omitted, CloudWatch generates a default
        returnData:
          type: boolean
          example: false
          description: >-
            This option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data
            values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do
            math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can
            specify False . If you omit this, the default of True is used.
        period:
          type: integer
          example: 300
          description: >-
            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For
            metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one
            minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For
            high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than
            one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of
            60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a
            PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.
