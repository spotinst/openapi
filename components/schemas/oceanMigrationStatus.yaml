      shouldTerminateDrainedNodes:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: >
          Ocean will terminate the old instances once the pods that reside on
          them are migrated, and the old instances are fully drained.
      shouldEvictStandAlonePods:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: >
          Ocean will terminate pods that do not belong to a Kubernetes
          deployment. This means that you would need to launch the pod manually
          (after the migration) due to the fact that there is no object that
          would do it automatically.
