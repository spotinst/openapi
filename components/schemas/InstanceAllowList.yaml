title: InstanceAllowList
description: >
  Restricts what instances can by used by pods:


  - On AWS, can be an instance type (ex: `i3.large`, `m5d.xlarge`) or an
  instance family (ex: `i3`, `m5d`).

  - On GCP, can be a machine type + VCPU spec (ex: `n2-highmem-4`,
  `n2-standard-2`) or a machine type (ex: `n2-highmem`, `n2-standard`).

  - On Azure, can be a VM size (ex: `standard_a2_v2`, `standard_e16-8_v3`) or a
  group of VM sizes (ex: `standard_a_v2`, `standard_e_v3`).
    The group name is obtained by removing the number of vCPU (and constrained vCPU if there is one) from the VM size, and does not
    necessarily map to a VM series. For Azure, this field is **not** case sensitive.
