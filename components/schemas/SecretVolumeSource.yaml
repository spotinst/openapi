      Optional: mode bits to use on created files by default. Must be a value
      between 0 and 0777. Defaults to 0644. Directories within the path are not
      affected by this setting. This might be in conflict with other options
      that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode
      bits set.

      If unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced
      Secret will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key
      and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected
      into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key
      is specified which is not present in the Secret, the volume setup will
      error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not
      contain the '..' path or start with '..'.
