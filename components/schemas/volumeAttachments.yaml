title: AWS Volume Attachments
description: >
  Any volumes specified in this field will be automatically attached to every
  instance launched in the group.

  All volumes must be located within the availability zone of the group. 

  Additionally, the group must have at least one persistence configuration.

  If your group has more than one instance or you want to share the same volume
  between several instances,

  it's important to use [Amazon EBS Multi-Attach supported
  volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html)

  to enable concurrent attachment of the volumes to multiple instances. This
  ensures that your volumes can be effectively

  shared among instances in your group.

            The device name to attach. When you attach a volume to your
            instance, you include a device name for the volume.

            Do not use a device name that is reserved for the root volume (for
            example - `/dev/sda1` or `/dev/xvda`).
          example: /dev/sdb
