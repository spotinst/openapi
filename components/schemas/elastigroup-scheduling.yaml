      The scheduling tasks for the group.
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        isEnabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >
            Describes whether the task is enabled. When true the task should run
            when false it should not run.
          example: true
        startTime:
          type: string
          description: >
            DATETIME in ISO-8601 format and is in UTC time. Sets a start time
            for scheduled actions.

            If "frequency" or "cronExpression" are not used - the task will run
            only once at the start time and will then be deleted from the group
            configuration.
          example: '2018-05-23T10:55:09Z'
        frequency:
          type: string
          description: |
            The recurrence frequency to run this task.
            Only one of ‘frequency' or ‘cronExpression' should be used at a time
          enum:
            - hourly
            - daily
            - weekly
          example: hourly
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          description: >
            A valid cron expression.

            The cron is running in UTC time zone and is in Unix cron format Cron
            Expression Validator Script.

            Only one of ‘frequency' or ‘cronExpression' should be used at a
            time.
          example: 0 1 * * *
        taskType:
          type: string
          description: >
            The task type to run. For stateful groups, use only those who has a
            `stateful` prefix, or `backup_ami`. For non-stateful group, use the
            rest.
          enum:
            - backup_ami
            - scale
            - scaleUp

            - scaleDown

            - clusterRoll (For ECS Integration)
            - statefulUpdateCapacity
            - statefulRecycle
          example: scale
        scaleTargetCapacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The target capacity of the group.
            Should be used when choosing ‘taskType' of ‘scale'.
        scaleMinCapacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The min capacity of the group.
            Should be used when choosing ‘taskType' of ‘scale'.
        scaleMaxCapacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The max capacity of the group.
            Required when ‘taskType' is ‘scale'.
        targetCapacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
