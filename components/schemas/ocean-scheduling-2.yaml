          type: boolean
          example: true
          description: >
            Describes whether the task is enabled. When True, the task runs.
            When False, it does not run. Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          example: 0 1 * * *
          description: >
            A valid cron expression. For example : " * * * * * ". The cron job
            runs in UTC time and is in Unix cron format. (See the Cron
            Expression Validator Script.) Only one of ‘frequency' or
            ‘cronExpression' can be used at a time.

            The activity that you are scheduling. Valid values: "clusterRoll".

                    Value as a percent to set the size of a batch in a roll.
                    Valid values are 0-100.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in
                    single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single
                    batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If
                    exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In
                    case of null as value, the default value in the backend will
                    be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in
                    percentage (%) of the batch.
