title: TimeoutPolicy
type: string
description: >-
  A TimeoutPolicy is an action that needs to be run when a timeout reaches its
  end.

  For now, only KILL is supported, but to make the API extensible we require the

  policy to be set. Future policies may include behaviours like "NOTIFY" instead
  of

  just killing the application.
enum:
  - KILL
