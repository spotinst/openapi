title: Volume Specification Object
description: >
  EBS volume specifications such as volume type, IOPS, and size (GiB) that will
  be requested for the EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance in the cluster -
  required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined.
properties:
  volumeType:
    type: string
    description: >
      The volume type. Volume types supported are `gp2`, `io1`, and `standard` -
      required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined
    enum:
      - gp2
      - io1
      - standard
    example: io1
  dynamicVolumeSize:
    $ref: ./dynamicVolumeSize.yaml
  sizeInGB:
    type: integer
    description: >
      The volume size, in gigabytes (GiB). This can be a number from 1 - 1024.
      **If the volume type is EBS-optimized, the minimum value is 10** -
      required if `ebsConfiguration` is defined
    example: 8
  iops:
    type: integer
    description: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports.
    example: 200
