      The actions in the cluster to be scheduled.

        - taskType
      properties:
        isEnabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >
            Describes whether the task is enabled. When true, the task will run.
            When false, it does not run. Required for the object
            cluster.scheduling.tasks.
          example: false
        cronExpression:
          type: string
          description: >
            A valid cron expression, for example " * * * * * ". The cron runs in
            the UTC time zone and is in Unix cron format [Cron Expression
            Validator Script](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/5/crontab/).
            Only one of ‘frequency' or ‘cronExpression' should be used at a
            time. Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.

                    Value as a percent to set the size of a batch in a roll.
                    Valid values are 0-100.

                    Indicates the threshold of minimum healthy instances in
                    single batch. If the amount of healthy instances in single
                    batch is under the threshold, the cluster roll will fail. If
                    exists, the parameter value will be in range of 1-100. In
                    case of null as value, the default value in the backend will
                    be 50%. Value of param should represent the number in
                    percentage (%) of the batch.
