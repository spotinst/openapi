title: Strategy Object
description: >
  The strategy for creating the group. At least one of `wrapping`, `cloning`, or
  `new` is required.
properties:
  wrapping:
    type: object
    description: >
      Required unless either of `strategy.cloning` or `strategy.new` is
      specified. In wrap mode, MRScaler will manage an existing cluster and will
      scale up/down cluster task groups only. MRScaler will manage only instance
      groups that were created by Spot.
    properties:
      sourceClusterId:
        type: string
        example: c-1234
  new:
    type: object
    description: >
      Required unless `strategy.wrapping` or `strategy.cloning` is specified. In
      new mode, MRScaler will create a new cluster with the parameters specified
      in the request.
    properties:
      releaseLabel:
        type: string
        example: emr-5.17.0
      numberOfRetries:
        type: integer
        example: 5
  cloning:
    type: object
    description: >
      Required unless either of `strategy.wrapping` or `strategy.new` is
      specified. In clone mode, MRScaler will create a new cluster that will be
      copied from the origin cluster. MRScaler will manage the entire cluster
      (the origin cluster will not be affected)
    properties:
      originClusterId:
        type: string
        description: The ID of the cluster to clone
        example: j-38EE27G2QY02I
      includeSteps:
        type: boolean
        description: Include cloning of steps from the original cluster
        example: false
      numberOfRetries:
        type: integer
        description: number of times to retry if provisioning timeout is exceeded
        example: 5
  provisioningTimeout:
    type: object
    description: >
      EMR clusters occasionally get stuck in provisioning status due to
      unhealthy clusters, slowness or other issues. In such cases, a timeout can
      be used to automatically terminate the cluster after the defined period of
      time.
    properties:
      timeout:
        type: integer
        description: >
          Time (minutes) after which the cluster is automatically terminated if
          it's still in provisioning status.
        example: 15
      timeoutAction:
        type: string
        enum:
          - terminate
          - terminateAndRetry
        description: >
          Desired action if the timeout is exceeded. Currently `terminate` and
          `terminateAndRetry` are supported.
        example: terminate
