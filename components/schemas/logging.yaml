          Exports your cluster's logs to the S3 bucket and subdir configured on
          the S3 [data integration](/#operation/DataIntegrationCreate) given.

          Each file contains logs of 3 minutes where each log is separated by a
          new line and saved as a JSON.

          The file formats are
          `subdir`/`accountId`_`oceanId`_`oceanName`_`startTime`.log

          If no subdir was configured, the files will be saved in the root of
          the bucket.
