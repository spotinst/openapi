      Optional: mode bits to use on created files by default. Must be a value
      between 0 and 0777. Defaults to 0644. Directories within the path are not
      affected by this setting. This might be in conflict with other options
      that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode
      bits set.
