properties:
  effect:
    description: >-
      Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint
      effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule
      and NoExecute.
    title: Effect
    type: string
  key:
    description: >-
      Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all
      taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination
      means to match all values and all keys.
    title: Key
    type: string
  operator:
    description: >-
      Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are
      Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for
      value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

    type: string
  tolerationSeconds:
    description: >-
      TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must
      be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the
      taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever
      (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
      immediately) by the system.
    title: Tolerationseconds
    type: integer
  value:
    description: >-
      Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is
      Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
