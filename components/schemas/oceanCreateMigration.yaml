        example:
          - i-a12345

      shouldTerminateDrainedNodes:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: >
          Ocean will terminate the old instances once the pods that reside on
          them are migrated, and the old instances are fully drained.
      shouldEvictStandAlonePods:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: >
          Ocean will terminate pods that do not belong to a Kubernetes
          deployment. This means that you would need to launch the pod manually
          (after the migration) due to the fact that there is no object that
          would do it automatically.
      forcePodEvictionOnPdbFailure:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: >
          Ocean will force the Pod eviction from the instance, even if the
          distributed budget is not satisfied.
      batchSize:
        type: integer
        example: 50
        description: >
          Indicates (in percentage) the batch size of the migration (meaning,
          how many nodes to migrate in each batch).\

          Cannot be null.
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 50
